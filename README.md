Executable examples for [DeepSampler](https://github.com/ppi-ag/deep-sampler)

# Content
1. __Basic setup:__ The following examples demonstrate how to set up the basics for JUnit-tests with deepsampler. 
They also show, how methods can be stubbed using the `Sample`-API. 
   1. JUnit4 & Spring
   2. [JUnit4 & Guice](deepsampler-hello-world-guice-junit4)
   3. JUnit5 & Spring
   4. JUnit5 & Guice
2. __Recording & Loading samples:__ The following examples demonstrate, how test data (samples) can be recorded at
runtime, and how persistent samples can be loaded in tests. 
   1. Saving and loading samples with default configuration
   2. Tweaking filenames and paths
   3. Adding custom `JsonSerializer`s and `JsonDeserializer`s to persist data, that cannot be persisted by DeepSampler 
   out of the box
   4. Adding custom `PersistenBeanExtension`s to persist data, that cannot be persisted by DeepSampler
      out of the box
   5. Using custom matchers
3. __Using the low-level-api without annotations:__ DeepSampler provides a low-level-api in case it is used 
without JUnit, or special configurations are necessary.
   1. Defining stubs
   2. Saving and loading samples to/from disk
